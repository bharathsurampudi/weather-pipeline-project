# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
# ... (keep name, version, profile, paths, etc. above) ...

# Configuring models
models:
  weather_project: # This should match the project name
    # Apply configs to all models in the staging/ directory
    staging:
      +materialized: view  # Stage models as views by default
      +schema: staging     # Build staging models in a 'staging' schema
    # Apply configs to all models in the marts/ directory
    marts:
      +materialized: table # Mart models as tables by default
      +schema: analytics   # Build mart models in an 'analytics' schema
